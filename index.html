        <em>Period poverty</em> refers to the social, economic, political, and
        cultural barriers to menstrual products, education, and
        sanitation.Although period poverty is a widespread problem, there is a
        lack of research on the topic. <span>In 2019</span>, experts from
        academic institutions, Non Governmental Organizations, governments, UN
        organizations, and elsewhere came together to form the Global Menstrual
        Collective to solve this issue.The Global Menstrual Collective defines
        <strong>menstrual health</strong> as “a state of complete physical,
        mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
        infirmity, in relation to the menstrual cycle.” It notes that people
        should have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Access to information about menstruation, life changes, and hygiene
          practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to care for themselves during menstruation access to
          water, sanitation, and hygiene services.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to receive a diagnosis for menstrual cycle disorders and
          access to healthcare.
        </li>
        <li>
          A positive, supportive environment in which to make informed
          decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to participate in all aspects of life, such as going to
          work and school.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How period poverty affects people</h3>

      <p class="description">
        Period poverty can affect people in a variety of ways. It can make them
        feel embarrassed about or ashamed of their periods, and it causes young
        people to miss out on school due to a lack of menstrual products.
      </p>
      <h3>Health and hygiene</h3>
      <p class="description">
        People unable to access menstrual products have reportedTrusted Source
        using rags, toilet paper, and children&#39; diapers. Some people have
        also used the menstrual products they did have for longer than intended.
        Using these alternative products puts individuals at higher risk of
        urogenital infections, which are infections of the urinary and genital
        systems. These infections include urinary tract infections and bacterial
        infections.
      </p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p class="description">
        People who menstruate can have a negative experience of school or
        college if they are uncomfortable, distracted, or unable to participate
        due to menstrual leakage and odor.This experience can have long-term
        consequences. Poor school attendance affects a person&#39;s future
        earning potential, self-esteem, health outcomes, and sense of control.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Period poverty and menstruation stigma</h3>
      <p class="description">
        The issue of period poverty is shrouded in stigma. Although period
        poverty is a global public health crisis, the shame surrounding
        menstruation means that it goes largely unaddressed.Many cultures see
        menstruation as dirty and something that people should
        <strong>hide.</strong> Campaigners want to shift the focus to the fact
        that menstruating is biologically <strong>normal</strong> and
        healthy.The shame associated with periods prevents people from talking
        about them. This leads to a lack of dialogue regarding access to
        menstruation products, the tax on these products, and even the
        ingredients that they include.
